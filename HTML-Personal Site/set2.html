    <h4>Ideas for To Do List</h4>
    <img
      src="set1&2media/To_Do_List.png"
      alt="to do list picture"
      height="180"
    />

    <p>
      <u>Main Goal</u>: Allow user to add, rename, and delete tasks, and set and
      achieve goals
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Basic to-do list</li>
      <li>
        Allows the user to set how often they want to do a task as a goal, (and
        give the option to set a time/times to do that goal)
      </li>
      <li>As they do a task every day consecutively, they build a streak</li>
      <li>
        Sends a notification reminding them to do that task at the chosen time
        (e.g exercise every day at 8:00am)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Extension: <br />
      The same concept can be used to send reminders e.g someone sets a task to
      take out the trash at 8:00 a.m, then at 8 the app sends a notification as
      a reminder to take it out
    </p>

    <h4>Ideas for Message App</h4>

    <img src="set1&2media/message.jpeg" alt="to do list picture" height="220" />

    <p><u>Main Goal</u>: Send a message to a recipient at a certain time</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Would be able to collect and store data about a contact's birthday,
        anniversary, etc and send a message when that time arrives
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows the user to choose whether to repeat sending the message forever
        or send it just once
      </li>
      <li>
        The message could be a default message like “Happy birthday!” or a
        custom message (If longer than a certain length, would warn the user but
        let them keep going)
      </li>
      <li>
        Would be able to remind the sender a day or up to a week in advance
        about the “special” day
      </li>
      <li>Allows the user to pick the exact time the message would be sent</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Extension: The same concept can be used to send reminders, e.g remind
      someone every day at a certain time to take their medication
    </p>

    <h4>Ideas for Coding productivity app</h4>

    <img
      src="set1&2media/codingproductivity.png"
      alt="to do list picture"
      height="250"
    />

    <p>
      <u>Main Goal:</u> It locks your phone until you have spent a certain
      amount of time in a code editor.
    </p>

    <p>Other ideas: There could be an “emergency” option or something</p>
