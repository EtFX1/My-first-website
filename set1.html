  <h4>Ideas for DATE & TIME CALCULATOR</h4>

  <img src="set1&2media/datetime.jpeg" alt="to do list picture" height="220"/> 

  <u><p>Main goals:</p></u>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Add and subtract 2 lengths of time <br>
      (e.g 5hrs 40 minutes + 3hr. 10 mins)<br>
      (e.g how many minutes are there between 4 hours 15 minutes and 2 hours 56 minutes)
    </li>
    
    <br>

    <li>
      Calculate the exact time between 2 dates including the present time <br>
      (e.g how many days between Sunday, January 23rd 2022 and March 6th 2022) <br>
      (e.g how long ago was January 5 1947) <br>
      (e.g how many hours ago was I born?) <br>
      (e.g what day was 2 weeks ago from today?) <br>
    </li>

    <br>
        
    <font size="-1">
      Might extend to calculate future times and dates <br>
      (e.g how long is September 25, 2029, from now/selected date) <br>
      (e.g when is my 40th Birthday/Anniversary from now/selected date or time) <br>
    </font>

    <br>
            
    <li>
      Convert different times <br>
      (e.g convert 5 hours 51 minutes to seconds) <br>
    </li>
  </ol>
